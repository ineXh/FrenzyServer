Bug: Unit observed to increase in hp after killing an opponent
This is due to:
1. Client A unit kills Client B Unit
2. in Game.js, getCoin function, Client A will set sync_force to be true
3. Server receives dmg that kills Client B Unit and set requireUpdate to be true
4. Server sends a force update to Client A and B which will list Client B unit as Dead and Client A unit to be before Client A's unit has suffered dmg from Client B's unit, which recovers Client A unit's health on both clients
5. Client B will send msg on damaging Client A unit
6. Server receives dmg dealt to Client A unit from Client B
7. Server sends periodic update to Clients, and Client A unit will reflect its true hp
